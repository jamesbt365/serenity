//! A set of permissions for a role or user. These can be assigned directly to a role or as a
//! channel's permission overrides.
//!
//! For convenience, methods for each permission are available, which can be used to test if the
//! set of permissions contains a single permission. This can simplify code and reduce a potential
//! import.
//!
//! Additionally, presets equivalent to the official client's `@everyone` role presets are
//! available. These are [`PRESET_GENERAL`], [`PRESET_TEXT`], and [`PRESET_VOICE`].
//!
//! Permissions follow a hierarchy:
//! - An account can grant roles to users that are of a lower position than its highest role;
//! - An account can edit roles lesser than its highest role, but can only grant permissions they
//!   have;
//! - An account can move only roles lesser than its highest role;
//! - An account can only kick/ban accounts with a lesser role than its top role.
//!
//! **Note**: The following permissions require the owner account (e.g. the owner of a bot) to use
//! two-factor authentication in the case that a guild has guild-wide 2FA enabled:
//! - [Administrator]
//! - [Ban Members]
//! - [Kick Members]
//! - [Manage Channels]
//! - [Manage Guild]
//! - [Manage Messages]
//! - [Manage Roles]
//! - [Manage Webhooks]
//!
//! [Administrator]: Permissions::ADMINISTRATOR
//! [Ban Members]: Permissions::BAN_MEMBERS
//! [Kick Members]: Permissions::KICK_MEMBERS
//! [Manage Channels]: Permissions::MANAGE_CHANNELS
//! [Manage Guild]: Permissions::MANAGE_GUILD
//! [Manage Messages]: Permissions::MANAGE_MESSAGES
//! [Manage Roles]: Permissions::MANAGE_ROLES
